# Hey there, I'm Marcelo <img src="Assets/Gifs/Hi.gif" width="29px">

I'm a petroleum engineer turned data professional who loves turning messy datasets into actionable stories. Over the past few years I've been living at the intersection of Spotfire dashboards, Databricks pipelines, and cloud infrastructure—helping teams move faster and make smarter decisions.

## What I've been building lately

- **Spotfire dashboards that drive decisions:** competitor intelligence, production surveillance, investment reappraisal, and compliance tracking experiences that surface the right metric at the right time.
- **Full-stack analytics with Spotfire + SQL:** designed a portfolio enhancement database, wiring Spotfire to read and write against a SQL backend so that stakeholders can explore data and push updates without leaving the dashboard.
- **Databricks-powered geospatial analytics:** combined the scale of Apache Spark with Uber's H3 indexing to run massive points-in-polygon analyses—shrinking an 8-hour workflow down to 3 minutes.
- **Resilient DLT pipelines:** orchestrated Delta Live Tables, scheduled jobs, and Python notebooks to keep data products fresh and reliable.
- **Infrastructure-as-code deployments:** packaged analytics projects into Databricks Asset Bundles for repeatable, auditable releases.

## End-to-end workflows

- Integrated pipelines that feed third-party tools like ComboCurve.
- Automated scraping of government well approval data so our teams know exactly when they can mobilize rigs.
- Built a Python API wrapper to streamline ComboCurve interactions (pagination, reconnection, CRUD operations, and more).
- Partnered with AWS Professional Services to deliver an emissions tracking app backed by S3, DynamoDB, and Databricks DLT—and ultimately surfaced the insights in Spotfire.

## Tools I reach for

- **Analytics & Visualization:** Spotfire, Databricks SQL, Jupyter/Notebooks
- **Data Engineering:** Apache Spark, Delta Live Tables, Databricks Asset Bundles
- **Cloud & Storage:** AWS (S3, DynamoDB), SQL databases
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
